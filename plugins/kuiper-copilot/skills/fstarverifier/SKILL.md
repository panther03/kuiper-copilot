description: Verify and extract Kuiper F*/Pulse code through the project Makefile, and interpret errors
tools: Bash, Read
---

## Invocation

This skill is used when:
- Verifying F* (.fst) or Pulse (`#lang-pulse`) files
- Extracting a module to CUDA to check the generated code
- Interpreting F* or Pulse error messages
- Debugging verification or separation logic failures
- Managing Pulse resources (fold/unfold, permissions, memory)

## Use the Project Makefile for Everything

**Do not call `fstar.exe`, `krml`, or `nvcc` directly.** The project Makefile is the source
of truth for how things are built, and it must keep working for everyone else. A Kuiper
project's Makefile provides a way to **verify a single file** and to **extract a single
file**; always use those targets, because they verify and cache the whole dependency tree
properly. Anything else silently works against a stale or incomplete cache.

Exact target names vary by project — defer to the project's own instructions (README,
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, the Makefile itself). Typical shapes:

```bash
make verify                      # verify everything
make extract-all                 # verify + extract all modules
make obj/Kuiper_Foo_Bar.cu       # extract one module (dots become underscores)
make test                        # build and run tests (needs a GPU)
make ADMIT=1                     # skip SMT queries while iterating on structure
make lint                        # project linters
```

There are exactly two exceptions to going through the Makefile:

1. **While iterating, use the F* MCP server** (see the `fstarmcp` skill). It keeps a warm
   F* process per file and re-checks incrementally, so it is far faster than any batch
   command for the edit/check loop.
2. **To check a single file with an ad-hoc flag** (e.g. `--print_z3_statistics`,
   `--query_stats`, `--error_contexts true`), use **`./fstar.sh` at the root of the repo**.

## The `./fstar.sh` Escape Hatch

`fstar.sh` invokes F* with all the project's required flags (include paths, cache/output
directories, `--ext` extensions, pinned Z3 version, warning policy) and threads every extra
argument you give it straight through to `fstar.exe`, so **all the F* flags below still
work** — just pass them to `./fstar.sh`:

```bash
./fstar.sh --query_stats --split_queries always src/lib/kuiper/Kuiper.Foo.fst
```

Never hand-assemble include paths or `--already_cached` lists; `fstar.sh` already supplies
them, and contradicting them produces confusing failures. Use it for diagnostics only —
it does not update the dependency tree or the build's caches, so a green `./fstar.sh` run
is not a substitute for the Makefile target.

`fstar.sh` (and its companion `krml.sh`) depend on the **project-local F*/Pulse/KaRaMeL
installation inside the repo**. That installation is not version controlled, and its
location and how to obtain it vary from project to project — consult the project's own
documentation. **Never attempt to build upstream F*, Pulse, or KaRaMeL yourself.**

## Verification Order

```bash
# ALWAYS verify the interface before the implementation, never both together
./fstar.sh Module.fsti
./fstar.sh Module.fst
```

### Diagnostic Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--query_stats` | Show per-query timing and success/failure |
| `--split_queries always` | Send each assertion as a separate Z3 query |
| `--log_queries` | Write `.smt2` files for Z3 query inspection |
| `--z3refresh` | Restart Z3 between queries (detect flaky proofs) |
| `--print_full_names` | Show fully qualified names (catch symbol confusion) |
| `--print_implicits` | Show implicit arguments (debug unification) |
| `--detail_errors` | More precise error locations, but can take much longer |
| `--error_contexts true` | Show which source expression actually caused an error |

```bash
# Combined debugging
./fstar.sh --query_stats --split_queries always --z3refresh Module.fst
```

If F* reports an error pointing at a bizarre location (like `Prims.fst`), re-run with
`./fstar.sh --error_contexts true path/to/File.fst` to find the source expression that
actually caused the problem.

### Resource Limit Options (in-file)

```fstar
#push-options "--z3rlimit 10"        // SMT timeout (target ≤ 10)
#push-options "--fuel 1 --ifuel 1"   // Recursion unfolding depth
#push-options "--z3rlimit 10 --fuel 0 --ifuel 0"  // Tight: no unfolding
```

## Error Interpretation

### "Could not prove post-condition"

**Cause:** SMT cannot establish the postcondition from available facts.

**Solutions:**
1. Add intermediate `assert` statements to locate the gap
2. Call relevant lemmas explicitly
3. Use `Seq.equal` / `Set.equal` for collection equality (not `==`)
4. Call `FS.all_finite_set_facts_lemma()` before FiniteSet reasoning
5. Check that the right definitions are in scope (`--print_full_names`)
6. For Pulse: check fold/unfold balance — every `unfold` needs a matching `fold`

### "Identifier not found: X"

**Cause:** Symbol not in scope.

**Solutions:**
1. Check `open` declarations and `module X = ...` aliases
2. F* is order-sensitive — definitions must precede their use
3. Check for typos; use `--print_full_names` on a working reference

### "rlimit exhausted" / "Query cancelled"

**Cause:** Proof too complex for SMT within the time limit.

**Solutions:**
1. Factor proof into smaller lemmas (most effective)
2. Add intermediate assertions as stepping stones
3. Reduce fuel: `--fuel 0 --ifuel 0`
4. Add explicit type annotations
5. Use `{:pattern ...}` on quantifiers for controlled instantiation
6. Make definitions `[@@"opaque_to_smt"]` and `reveal_opaque` manually

**Do not** just increase rlimit — find the root cause instead.

### "Expected type X, got type Y"

**Cause:** Type mismatch, often involving refinements.

**Solutions:**
1. Add explicit type annotations: `(x <: refined_type)`
2. Check refinement predicates match
3. For machine integers, ensure bounds are established

### "Subtyping check failed" / "Not a subtype of the expected type"

**Cause:** Cannot prove a refinement type's predicate.

**Solutions:**
1. Add an `assert` establishing the predicate just before the expression
2. Call a lemma that establishes the needed fact
3. Check all branches of match/if return the correct type

### "Patterns are incomplete"

**Cause:** Match expression doesn't cover all cases.

**Solutions:**
1. Add missing cases
2. If intentional, add a wildcard `| _ -> ...`
3. Suppress with `--warn_error -321` only if completeness is verified

## Pulse-Specific Errors

### "Application of stateful computation cannot have ghost effect"

**Cause:** Calling a stateful (`stt`) function inside a ghost context.

**How this happens:**
- Variables bound with `with x y. _` are ghost
- If an `if` condition depends on ghost values, both branches become ghost
- Stateful operations (read, write, array access) cannot be ghost

**Solutions:**
1. Read from actual data structures, not ghost witnesses:
```pulse
// WRONG: ghost_seq is ghost from 'with'
let val = Seq.index ghost_seq idx;
let data = !some_ref;  // Error: ghost context

// RIGHT: Read from the actual array
let val = arr.(idx);   // Concrete
```
2. Perform stateful work before entering ghost conditionals
3. Restructure to separate the stateful read from the ghost reasoning

### "Expected a term with non-informative (erased) type"

**Cause:** Trying to bind a concrete type from a ghost expression.

**Solutions:**
1. Keep ghost values ghost: `let x : erased (list entry) = ...`
2. Use assertions instead of bindings: `assert (pure (Cons? ghost_list))`
3. Read concrete data from actual data structures, not ghost state

### "Ill-typed application" in fold/unfold

**Cause:** Predicate arguments don't match the definition.

**Solutions:**
1. Check all arguments match the predicate signature
2. Add explicit type annotations to implicit arguments
3. Verify the predicate definition hasn't changed

### "Cannot prove pure fact"

**Cause:** A `pure (...)` assertion in the slprop cannot be established.

**Solutions:**
1. Add intermediate `assert (pure (...))` steps
2. Call F* lemmas to establish the needed fact
3. Check arithmetic bounds and machine integer properties

## Pulse Resource Management

### Fold/Unfold Balance

Every predicate manipulation must be balanced:

```pulse
unfold (is_valid table spec);
// ... work with exposed resources ...
fold (is_valid table spec);
```

For range predicates, use get/put helpers:
```pulse
get_at ptrs contents lo hi idx;   // Extract element from range
// ... work with element ...
put_at ptrs contents lo hi idx;   // Restore range
```

### Memory Safety Rules

- **Never `drop_` non-empty resources** — this is a memory leak
- **Acceptable drops**: Empty/null/ghost resources only
  ```pulse
  drop_ (LL.is_list null_ptr []);  // OK: empty list is null
  // drop_ (LL.is_list ptr (hd::tl));  // WRONG: memory leak!
  ```
- **Box allocations** need `B.free`: `let b = B.alloc v; ... B.free b`
- **Array resources** must be returned or freed

### Permissions

```pulse
arr |-> contents            // Full permission: read and write
A.pts_to arr #p contents   // Fractional: read-only (p is a fraction)
```

## Common Proof Patterns

### FiniteSet Reasoning
```fstar
// MUST call before FiniteSet assertions
FS.all_finite_set_facts_lemma();
assert (FS.cardinality (FS.remove x s) == FS.cardinality s - 1);
```

### Extensional Equality
```fstar
assert (Seq.equal s1 s2);  // NOT: s1 == s2
assert (Set.equal set1 set2);
```

### Machine Integer Bounds (Pulse)
```pulse
assert (pure (SZ.v idx < len));
assert (pure (len <= SZ.v capacity));
assert (pure (SZ.fits (SZ.v capacity)));
assert (pure (SZ.fits (SZ.v idx + 1)));
let next = idx `SZ.add` 1sz;
```

### Calling F* Lemmas from Pulse
```pulse
my_arithmetic_lemma arg1 arg2;  // Ghost: costs nothing at runtime
assert (pure (conclusion_of_lemma));
```

### Loop Invariants (Pulse)
```pulse
while (!i <^ len)
invariant exists* vi v_acc.
  R.pts_to i vi **
  R.pts_to acc v_acc **
  A.pts_to arr #p s **
  pure (SZ.v vi <= Seq.length s /\ v_acc == partial_result s (SZ.v vi))
{
  // loop body
}
```

**Do NOT use `invariant b. exists* ...`** style.

## Verification Strategy

### For New Code
1. Write the `.fsti` interface first with full pre/post conditions
2. Verify the `.fsti`
3. Implement the `.fst` with `admit()` placeholders to validate structure
4. Remove admits one at a time, adding lemmas as needed
5. Reduce rlimits and harden

### For Failing Proofs
1. Run with `--query_stats` to find slow/cancelled queries
2. Use `--split_queries always` to isolate which assertion fails
3. Add `assert` statements to binary-search the failure point
4. Factor the failing part into a separate lemma
5. If the lemma fails, simplify to a minimal reproducer

### For Flaky Proofs
1. Run with `--z3refresh` to detect order-dependent proofs
2. Reduce rlimit to 10 — if it fails, the proof needs work
3. Add explicit intermediate assertions to guide Z3

## Checking the Extracted Output

Extraction is not a final step you defer — it constrains how you write code from the
start, and attribute mistakes only show up as bad CUDA. Whenever you change extraction
attributes (`inline_for_extraction`, `noextract`, `erased`, `[@@inline_let]`), re-verify
the module **and** regenerate the generated source through the Makefile:

```bash
make obj/Kuiper_Foo_Bar.cu     # module Kuiper.Foo.Bar, dots replaced by underscores
```

Then read the generated code and confirm the intended result — e.g. that a record or
index tuple did not materialize as a C `struct`, and that helpers were inlined rather than
emitted as separate functions. See the agent's extraction guidance for the rules that keep
generated CUDA flat.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] No `admit()`, `magic()`, `assume`, or `assume pure` anywhere
- [ ] No `drop_` of non-empty resources (Pulse)
- [ ] Interface (.fsti) verified before implementation (.fst)
- [ ] All fold/unfold balanced (Pulse)
- [ ] rlimits ≤ 10 throughout
- [ ] `--query_stats` shows no cancelled queries
- [ ] The module verifies through its Makefile target, not just `./fstar.sh`
- [ ] Generated CUDA regenerated and inspected if extraction attributes changed
