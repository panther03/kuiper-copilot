## Invocation

This skill is used when:
- A proof fails and you need to find out why
- Proofs are slow or flaky
- You need to systematically isolate a verification failure

## Debugging Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Failing Query

```bash
./fstar.sh --query_stats --split_queries always Module.fst 2>&1 | grep -E 'cancelled|failed|succeeded'
```

- `--query_stats` shows time and result per query
- `--split_queries always` separates each assertion into its own query
- Look for `cancelled` (timeout) or `failed` queries

### Step 2: Isolate the Failure Point

Use `admit()` as a binary search tool:

```fstar
let my_proof () : Lemma (ensures conclusion) =
  step1;
  assert (fact1);      // Does this pass?
  admit();             // Cut here — if it passes, failure is below
  step2;
  assert (fact2);      // Move admit() down to find exact failure
  step3
```

Move the `admit()` down until the proof fails again. The assertion just before
the `admit()` position is where Z3 gets stuck.

### Step 3: Factor Out the Failing Part

Extract the failing assertion into a standalone lemma:

```fstar
// Separate lemma — easier to debug in isolation
let helper_lemma (x: t)
  : Lemma (requires precondition x) (ensures failing_fact x)
  = // prove it here, with full focus

let my_proof () : Lemma (ensures conclusion) =
  step1;
  helper_lemma arg;    // Call the helper
  step2;
  step3
```

Small lemmas are easier for Z3, easier to understand, and more reusable.

### Step 4: Harden the Proof

Once it passes, reduce rlimits:

```fstar
#push-options "--z3rlimit 10 --fuel 0 --ifuel 0"
let my_proof () : Lemma (...) = ...
#pop-options
```

If it fails at low rlimit, add more intermediate assertions rather than
increasing the limit.

## Common Root Causes and Fixes

### Z3 Doesn't Know a Library Fact

**Symptom:** Assertion about sequences, sets, or arithmetic fails.

**Fix:** Call the appropriate lemma:
```fstar
// FiniteSet facts
FS.all_finite_set_facts_lemma();

// Sequence properties
Seq.lemma_eq_intro s1 s2;

// Arithmetic
FStar.Math.Lemmas.pow2_plus a b;
```

### Extensional vs Propositional Equality

**Symptom:** `s1 == s2` fails but the sequences are clearly equal.

**Fix:** Use extensional equality:
```fstar
assert (Seq.equal s1 s2);      // Compares element-by-element
// NOT: assert (s1 == s2);     // Requires decidable equality proof
```

Same for sets: use `Set.equal`, not `==`.

### Quantifier Instantiation Failure

**Symptom:** A `forall` property is known but Z3 can't use it.

**Fixes:**
1. Add a pattern (trigger):
```fstar
forall (x:t). {:pattern (f x)} P x
```

2. Instantiate manually with a lemma call:
```fstar
my_forall_lemma specific_value;
assert (P specific_value);
```

3. Make the definition opaque and reveal selectively:
```fstar
[@@"opaque_to_smt"]
let complex_def = ...

let use_it (x:t) : Lemma (P x) =
  reveal_opaque (`%complex_def) complex_def
```

### Type Refinement Not Available

**Symptom:** Z3 knows `x < 100` but can't prove `x < 200`.

**Fix:** Add explicit assertion chains:
```fstar
assert (x < 100);     // Known
assert (100 <= 200);   // Trivial
assert (x < 200);      // Now provable
```

### Large File / Slow Verification

**Symptom:** Proofs that worked in small files break in large ones.

**Fixes:**
1. Split the module — move helper lemmas to a separate `.fst` file
2. Reduce fuel/ifuel to 0 where possible
3. Use `#push-options` / `#pop-options` to scope rlimit changes
4. Make definitions `[@@"opaque_to_smt"]` when not needed by nearby proofs

### Using assert_spinoff for Query Isolation

`assert_spinoff (P)` creates a separate Z3 query for P, preventing it from
bloating the main proof context. Use when:
- A function has many assertions and Z3 is slow on all of them
- You want to prove a property without polluting the main query context
- Individual assertions are fast but the combined query times out

```fstar
let complex_proof () : Lemma (...) =
  step1;
  assert_spinoff (intermediate_fact1);  // Proven in isolation
  assert_spinoff (intermediate_fact2);  // Proven in isolation
  // Main proof continues with both facts available but Z3 didn't have
  // to carry the burden of proving them while also proving the rest
  final_step
```

### Predicate Abstraction

When you have large, repeated predicate expressions copied across multiple
functions or assertions:

1. Extract into a named predicate: `let my_pred x y = ...`
2. Write pure lemmas relating predicates to each other
3. Use fold/unfold (in Pulse) to control when Z3 sees internals
4. This dramatically reduces proof complexity and Z3 work

```fstar
// BAD: large inline predicate repeated in 5 places
ensures (forall i. 0 <= i /\ i < length arr ==> index arr i >= 0 /\ index arr i < bound /\ ...)

// GOOD: named predicate with a lemma
let all_in_bounds (arr: seq int) (bound: int) = forall i. 0 <= i /\ i < length arr ==> ...
val all_in_bounds_preserved : arr:_ -> bound:_ -> i:_ -> Lemma (...)
```

### Wrong Symbol (Copy-Paste Bug)

**Symptom:** Proof fails inexplicably; the code "looks right."

**Fix:** Use `--print_full_names --print_implicits`:
```bash
./fstar.sh --print_full_names --print_implicits Module.fst
```

Check that each symbol resolves to the intended module. A function copied from
another module may reference the wrong qualified name.

## Pulse-Specific Debugging

### Resource Mismatch

**Symptom:** "Could not prove post-condition" with separation logic.

**Debugging approach:**
1. Add `assert` for each slprop component to find which one is missing
2. Check fold/unfold balance
3. Verify `rewrite` targets are correct
4. Ensure no resource was accidentally dropped

### Ghost Context Confusion

**Symptom:** "Application of stateful computation cannot have ghost effect."

**Debugging approach:**
1. Check if you're inside a `with ... . _` scope
2. Check if the `if` condition depends on ghost values
3. Restructure: do stateful reads before ghost reasoning

### Lemma Calls Failing in Pulse

**Symptom:** A lemma works in pure F* but fails when called from Pulse.

**Debugging approach:**
1. Verify the exact precondition with `assert (pure (precondition))` before the call
2. Use `--print_full_names` to verify the lemma resolves to the right definition
3. Check that value-level equalities match what the lemma expects
   (e.g., `U64.v x = U64.v y` vs `x == y`)
4. Try calling the lemma outside the current conditional/loop scope — Pulse scoping
   can affect what facts Z3 has available
5. Factor the lemma call into a separate pure F* helper function and call that
   from Pulse — this isolates whether the issue is in Pulse's VC generation or
   in the lemma itself

## Anti-Patterns

### Increasing rlimit Instead of Fixing

❌ `#push-options "--z3rlimit 300"` — masks the problem, creates flaky proof

✅ Factor into smaller lemmas with `--z3rlimit 10`

### Blaming the Tool

❌ "Pulse can't handle this pattern" (without evidence)

✅ Produce a minimal reproducer; check for mundane bugs first

### Accepting Flaky Proofs

❌ "It passes sometimes, so it's fine"

✅ Run with `--z3refresh` and reduce rlimit until it's robust

### Admit and Move On

❌ `admit()` left in "for now"

✅ Extract the exact property into a named lemma and prove it

## Session Structure for Proof Work

1. **Exploration**: Understand the codebase and existing proofs
2. **Structure**: Write code with `admit()` placeholders to validate the approach
3. **Prove**: Remove admits one at a time, starting with the easiest
4. **Harden**: Reduce rlimits, run with `--z3refresh`, clean up
5. **Integrate**: Verify in the full build, commit
